# [Image Magic](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/89)

## Deskripsi Soal

It looks like someone messed up my picture! Can anyone reorganize the pixels? The python module PIL (Python Imaging Library) might be useful! https://mega.nz/#!OKxByZyT!vaabCJRG5D9zAUp7drTekcA5pszu67r_TbQMtxEzqGE

Update: I think whoever messed up my image took every column of pixels and put them side by side.
Update: I think the width of the image was 304 before they messed with it.
